<h1>Drink Info Project</h1>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>C# console application that displays information on various cocktails pulled from https://www.thecocktaildb.com/</p>
<h3>Assigned requirements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>All the data about the drinks is in an external database, accessible through an API.</li>
  <li>Your job is to create a system that allows the user to pull data from any drink in the database.</li>
  <li>You don't need SQL here, as you won't be operating the database. All you need is to create an user-friendly way to present the data to the users</li>
  <li>When the users open the application, they should be presented with the Drinks Category Menu and invited to choose a category. Then they'll have the chance to choose a drink and see information about it.</li>
  <li>When the users visualise the drink detail, there shouldn't be any properties with empty values
</li>
</ul>
